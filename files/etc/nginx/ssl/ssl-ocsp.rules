# OCSP stapling: nginx will poll the CA for signed OCSP responses, and
# send them to clients so clients don't make their own OCSP calls.
#
# The ssl_trusted_certificate is a chain of intermediates *including* the
# root certificate, and *excluding* the cert for your domain.
#
# See https://sslmate.com/blog/post/ocsp_stapling_in_apache_and_nginx
# for more details on how nginx handles OCSP.
