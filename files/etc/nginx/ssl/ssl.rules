# the http:// version for a redirect. Warning: it is difficult to change your mind.

#    includeSubdomains: force SSL for *ALL* subdomains (remove if this is not what you want)
#    preload: indicates you want browsers to ship with HSTS preloaded for your domain.
#
#    Submit your domain for preloading in browsers at: https://hstspreload.appspot.com
